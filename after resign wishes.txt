Hello All,

 

Its been 2+ years with Persistent and now itâ€™s time to say good bye, with heavy heart but excitement and anticipation of future. It has been a fantastic journey and a great learning experience where I have enjoyed every moment and I appreciate having the opportunity to work with each of you with whom I have interacted directly or indirectly.

 

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of you for your support and guidance during all these years and also thank all my supervisors who have helped me grow as a person and as a professional. Especially thankful to Shripad Agavekar, Vivek Thombare, Shailesh Gokhale for giving me the opportunity and guidance to explore different skills.

 

I am definitely going to miss memories of lunch, tea break with Prajyot, Poonam, Shalaka, Sayali, Sharada, Shradha, Deepak, Ashish.

 

It was a pleasure knowing each and every one of you. Wishing you all the best for the future.

Please stay in touch. You can reach me at ketanbhosale4@gmail.com or 9206047777.

 

Thanks and Regards,

Ketan Bhosale.
